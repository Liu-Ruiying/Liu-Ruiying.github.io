Hi, I'm Zhanli Li, currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Digital Economy (2023-2027) at the Wenlan School of Business, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law. From 2024 to February 2025, I am honored to be mentored by [Prof. Zichao Yang](https://www.yzc.me) of Zhongnan University of Economics and Law. Our research focuses on machine learning, microeconometrics, and corporate finance.

Currently, I am an intern working with [Prof. Yixuan Cao](https://yixuancao.github.io/) at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where we are focused on Document Agent. I am eager to pursue a PhD in Data Science, Statistics, Computer Science, or Fintech. If you have any ideas about my work or potential collaborations, feel free to reach out via email: lizhanli@stu.zuel.edu.cn.
